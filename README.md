# OBJECTIVE

The data given to us anonymized. The goal of the project is to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.
# Domain Analysis

#### 1. Introduction
The dataset provided is of a bank. The bank tracks and idenfy each and every transactions of their Customers. Now in this project our goal is to make a model to forecast which customer will make any transactions in the future.

#### 2. Contextual factors
The dataset provided to us has undergone anonymization, a process wherein the features or identifying information within the data are obscured or generalized. This practice is implemented to safeguard the real identities and uphold data privacy standards. Each bank diligently tracks transactions not only for banking purposes but also to offer additional services and to mitigate the risks of fraud. Anonymization serves as a crucial measure in ensuring that sensitive information remains protected while still enabling the utilization of valuable data for analysis and insights. 

#### 3. Data and Information

The dataset comprises 200 features alongside columns for ID_code and target. Within the target column, values of 0 denote customers who will not engage in a transaction, while values of 1 signify those who will. Majorly it is Numerical dataset.
## Report on Challenges Faced
1. The size of the given dataset was bigger than what we have executed till now.
2. The features were not provided, so EDA was not performed.
3. Evaluation of certain models were taking almost 2-3 days. So, basically we could not explore more models due to that.
